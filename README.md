- Delete or update amount of product in your shopping cart.
- Check your orders.
- Change order status (Delivered).
- Delete any order.
- Sort orders (Default, TotalPrice, Delivered).

## ðŸ“’ Process

I started by creating header. 

Then I added product card design. 

Afterwards i created states for cart, orders and products using framework zustand.

Also i created page /orders for checking your personal orders. You can sort them by (Default, TotalPrice, Delivered).

After that, I added a modal and a loader for better UI.

And finally made adaptive layout for different screens.

**NOTE:** The project's purpose is to test zustand and try to create my own design.
